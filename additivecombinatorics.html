<br><b> Title: </b>  The Sum Product Theorem and its Applications <br>
<br><b> Abstract: </b> The sum product theorem is a basic result in additive combinatorics with a variety of surprising applications. Simply stated, it states that over a field F that satisfies simple irreducibility criteria (which is satisfied for example by R and every prime field), for any arbitrary subset A of F, either the sum-set of A ( A + A) or the product-set of A (A XA) is large. This result has surprisingly many applications in diverse areas of mathematics. In this talk, we outline the applications the sum-product theorem by discussing applications in Combinatorial Geometry, Group Theory, Randomness Extractors, Number Theory. We also plan to cover at  least an outline of the proof of the Sum product theorem. Depending on the time we have, we might dive into the proof of the theorem too.

<p class="p2">If you are interested in attending, feel free to just show up. You can contact <a href="mailto:kotpravesh@gmail.com">me</a> to  add you to the mailing list or add yourself to <b> theoryseminar@utlists.utexas.edu</b></p>

<p class="p2">Here are a few general guidelines for the talks/discussions in these meetings.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span>1. The topics could be anything that discuss recent research in theoretical computer science, machine learning, and related areas in mathematics etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Ê</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span>2. Talks that throw a few open problems for the audience to think about are encouraged.<span class="s1"><br>
<br>
</span>3. The talks are expected to be of a little less formal nature than a standard 50 minute talk-10 minute questions format and the length/style of the presentation can be chosen by the speaker in order to suit the purpose.<span class="s1"><br>
<br>
</span><span class="Apple-converted-space">Ê</span>4. Instead of presenting all the theorems/results in a paper and making the talk information-packed, we expect the focus to be on a few results presented in enough detail so that an attentive listener can understand and appreciate the proof technique. <span class="s1"><br>
<br>
</span>--><!-- 5. Continuing in the same vein, "survey-type" talks which discuss a technique/tool and then discuss its applications (possibly unifying a few different papers) and related open questions are encouraged.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Ê</span></p>

<b> Title: </b> Noise Sensitivity of Boolean Functions and Applications to Learning <br>

<b>Abstract: </b> Noise Sensitivity measures the average amount of change in the value of a function when the input is subjected to a "small" random perturbation. Understanding noise sensitivity of different classes of boolean functions has had profound implications in learning theory and hardness amplification. In learning theory, noise sensitivity was first used by Adam Klivans, Ryan o'Donnell and Rocco Servedio in 2002 to show that intersections and thresholds of halfspaces are learnable under uniform distribution on the hypercube. Since then there have been a number of results that show learnability of boolean function classes by bounding noise sensitivity. In this talk we present the idea of noise sensitivity of boolean functions and discuss some applications in learning theory including our result on learning non-negative submodular functions.
